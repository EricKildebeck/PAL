# Quick start guide:

* Key dependency: Java JDK 8
	* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
	* Or as appropriate with Oracle
	* You may have to sign in and create an account.
* Get Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
	* Download and install with all defaults
* Clone repo (if repo is not already cloned): 
	* Navigate to target folder for installing Polycraft AI Lab
	* Run command prompt/PowerShell
	* git clone https://github.com/StephenGss/PAL.git
* Pull updates (if repo is already cloned):
* Run LaunchPolycraft.bat
	* If it fails, try running ./gradelw runclient from PowerShell in the same window, read the error, and fix it your own based on local configuration
* Run PAL -> PolycraftAIGym -> testSocket.py
	* Send "START" to put PAL in a state where it can receive communications
		* Wait for the Polycraft window to change to a plain field
	* Send "RESET domain ../available_levels/pogo_nonov.json
		* Or other level as needed. See Tasks and Novelties
	* Send API sense commands or action commands. Such as:
		* "SENSE_ALL NONAV" to get information about the player's environment
		* "MOVE W" to move forward
		* "BREAK_BLOCK" to break the block immediately in front of the player
		* Many more commands described in Command API section

# Polycraft Bot API
The Polycraft World AI API consists of 28 total different API commands at Release 1.5.0 on 5.4.2020. These commands are broken down into SYSTEM commands, DEV commands, and GAME commands. The GAME commands are further divided into MOVE commands, SENSE commands, INTERACT commands.
## SYSTEM commands: (2 total)

		* -d (domain) path to .json novelty transform 
		* called 1,000 times per tournament to start a new trial
		* different tournaments will run using cloned TA2 agents on different cloud machines
		* novelty will be pre-set in the .jsons and not generated at run-time

## DEV commands: (4 total)
* Dev commands must be enabled by setting a client virtual machine argument: "-Ddev=True" Details on setting this outside of a development environment are still being worked out, as solutions are fickle and system dependent. Please contact us if you need these commands.
* **CHAT** "Hello world."
* **CHAT** /give @p minecraft:stick
	* not used in DRY-RUN Tournaments, but active for debugging/training/development

		* Novelty generators for level zero (rearranging objects) are not included currently but will be soon
		* not used in DRY-RUN Tournaments, but provides agents in training a simple way to try out different seeds and different intensities during training within the same tournament
		* -d (domain) path to .json novelty transform -s (seed) arbitrary INT -i (intensity) INT 0-100
		* generates novelty at run time for training purposes
